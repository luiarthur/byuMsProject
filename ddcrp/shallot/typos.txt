p.1:
1) G ~ DP(aG_0) => G ~ DP(G_0,a) to be consistent with Neal's paper.
2) library("shallot") => library(shallot)
3) "mcmc.parameters" doesn't work:
    Error in mcmc.parameters(log.density.NAME = "jainneal.log.predictive.density") :
    could not find function ".jengine"

# Other problems:
  my crp and his ddcrp (when set to crp) doesn't behave the same way.
