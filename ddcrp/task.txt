1) Read ddcrp: Blei Paper & Code
2) Change sampling model in paper to what Dr. Dahl wants (shallot)
3) Review Radford Neal 
    a) Auxilliary Gibbs
    b) Dahl's Code
4) Want to supply distance matrix into code (not only function to calculate matrix)
5) Sample from ddcrp: find or tweak from Beli's code
6) Clean code: put parameters at the top of the code
7) return cluster labels

Trick to sample from prior:
  P(pi|y) = P(y|pi)*P(pi) / P(y)
  - So to sample from prior, just set P(y|pi) = 1

#------

1) Get the MC chain from Blei's code
2) Code up Blei's stuff on my own
#------

1) See if the two Dahl's properties hold
2) given a distance matrix, return partition
