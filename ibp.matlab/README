CONTENTS

Included in this distribution is matlab code to generate posterior samples for
linear Gaussian and binary matrix factorization (noisy-or) Indian Buffet
Process models.  Three different posterior sampling algorithms are provided:
Gibbs, reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC), and sequential
importance sampling (SIS).  Only the Gibbs and SIS samplers are provided for
the linear Gaussian IBP models.

GETTING STARTED

The 'ibp' root directory has the code for binary matrix factorization.  Open
the file 'test.m' first.  This code shows how to run each of the samplers.  The
'ibp/linear_gaussian_model' directory contains complimentary code for the
linear gaussian IBP model.  

APOLOGIES

The code is very poorly documented.  Evidence of its usage will promote
commenting and cleaning of the code by its authors.
